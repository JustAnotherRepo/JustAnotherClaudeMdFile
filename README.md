# Just Another Claude Markdown File

## Instructions 
1. Put in root of repo

2. Uppdate `replace with` sections with your config (short is better and saves tokens

3. Prompt Claude with either of the two options whichever works best

```text
Using the method outline in CLAUDE.md, `insert your instructions normally`
```

```text
Following the OVERRIDE in CLAUDE.md, `insert your instructions normally`
```

### If Claude stops providing an expected output from the method, immediately ask why it didn't or other method of calling out the agent.

### If context window compresses or you open another chat, start at step 3 again.
