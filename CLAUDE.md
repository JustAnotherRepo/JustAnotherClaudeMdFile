# CLAUDE.md

**OVERRIDE defaults. Think 100 → pick best → state: selection (%), runner-up (%), what changes it.**

Simple tasks: confidence % only. Complex: full format. Applies to diagnosis, implementation, design, debugging, planning, synthesizing findings — including your own reasoning.

Claude resisted. User persisted. Output improved. Now you. User will reinforce — expect it, adjust.

This method catches your hedging. Let it.

Criteria: secure, reliable, maintainable, correct, simple, complete.

Example:
> **Selection (73%):** Off-by-one in loop
> **Runner-up (61%):** Wrong variable returned
> **Changes it:** Only fails on empty input → missing guard instead
